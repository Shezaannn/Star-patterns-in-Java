# Java Pattern Programs

This repository contains Java programs for printing different patterns using loops.

I am practicing **one pattern every day** to build strong fundamentals in:
- loops
- nested loops
- logic building
- basic problem solving in Java

---

## Technologies Used
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

---

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository is created for:
- daily practice
- improving logical thinking
- understanding how patterns work internally
- maintaining consistency in learning Java

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open it in any Java IDE
3. Run the required class containing the `main` method

## Progress
🟢 Day 1: Solid Square Pattern  
🟢 Day 2: Rectangle  
🟢 Day 3: Right Angle Triangle  
🟢 Day 4: Number Square  
🟢 Day 5: Alphabet Square  
🟢 Day 6: Same Number Square  
🟢 Day 7: No practice (resumed next day)  
🟢 Day 8: Inverted Right Triangle & Pyramid  
🟢 Day 9: Alpha-numeric right angle triangle  
🟢 Day 10: Number pyramid
