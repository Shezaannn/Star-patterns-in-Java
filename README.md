# Java Pattern Programs

This repository contains Java programs for printing different patterns using loops.

I am practicing **one pattern every day** to build strong fundamentals in:
- loops
- nested loops
- logic building
- basic problem solving in Java

---

## Patterns Covered So Far
- Solid Square Pattern

More patterns will be added daily.

---

## Technologies Used
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

---

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository is created for:
- daily practice
- improving logical thinking
- understanding how patterns work internally
- maintaining consistency in learning Java

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open it in any Java IDE
3. Run the required class containing the `main` method

## Progress
🟢 Day 1: Solid Square Pattern  
🟢 Day 2: Rectangle  
🟢 Day 3: Right Angle Triangle  
🟢 Day 4: Number Square

---

## Notes
